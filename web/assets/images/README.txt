Drop the provided image files here so the site can load them via relative paths.

Files you should copy from Downloads to this folder:
- OIP (6).webp
- 63f54049d0603ae3d6be702a_Slide 16_9 - 39.webp

After copying, refresh http://localhost/web/ and the product images will be used by the shop script.

Notes:
- Filenames must match exactly (including spaces and parentheses). If you prefer safe filenames, you can rename them (e.g. free-range.webp, organic.webp, bulk.webp) and update `c:\wamp64\www\web\jss\shop.js` accordingly.
- I updated `jss/shop.js` to reference these files at `assets/images/`.
